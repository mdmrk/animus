5 minutes prior to writing this blog post I was working on my new window manager configuration. Before putting all my efforts into it I was trying to create a template for Typst (a LaTeX style language), which took me some time to realise how to import. Meanwhile some thoughts inside my mind told me I had to resume my uni work.

Imagine a world where ideas are exciting but do not eat one another so they can all live together in the same place without being trashed, or even better... completed.

This has been happening to me since I got into programming and entered the computer world rabbit hole. See a new, appealing, interesting repository or post somewhere about something I'm into and suddenly I'm trying to make a big project with it, but only end up Hello-Worlding on it. Latest case was a project on Bevy Engine using Rust, which of course didn't go anywhere.

This blog was the result of project hopping + a desire of telling cool stories or documenting whatever. I was able to finish it and release it so I'm a little proud.

An advice for myself. Instead of wasting energy and time on several projects that only get to some shallow ideas and no actual usability, focus on one idea, make it and then figure out if it's worth it or not. Otherwise, I don't think I'll be getting anywhere.
