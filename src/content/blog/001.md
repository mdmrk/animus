## why

Building a personal blog/portfolio/testbed hoping I can run it for a week before jumping off to another project. I'm using english but I have plans to add spanish as well.

## how

Running with Astro, building this static site and hosting on Github Pages. I'm liking Astro so far and even more the theme this is based on [satnaing/astro-paper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper).

## emm

Using this as an experiment. Maybe it'll stay for long or I end up giving up after a while. Anyway, I'm trying to keep it up as blogging is something I like and now I think it's the right time.
