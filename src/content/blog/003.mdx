import Emoji from "@components/Emoji";

I <Emoji client:idle emoji="💙" /> emojis. Warning <Emoji client:idle emoji="⚠️" /> Many emojis ahead!

I'm a PC environment customization enthusiast. I love tweaking values, colors <Emoji client:idle emoji="🎨" /> and shapes to create my perfect <sub>_(never fullfills <Emoji client:idle emoji="😵‍💫" />)_</sub> stylized workspace. I probably spend hours browsing public projects and getting ideas for my next creations. Finding that color scheme, that shadow style, that font, that blur,... I am currently writing this from my [AwesomeWM rice](https://github.com/mdmrk/policromia) <Emoji client:idle emoji="🍙" />, which I still change from time to time. Anyway, I found out that this widely used things called emojis <Emoji client:idle emoji="😄" /> combine so well when used appropriately.

That point is when I came across the Apple <Emoji client:idle emoji="🍎" /> Color Emoji bundle, which is basically the emoji appearance that Apple's devices use by default on their UI, apps,... Despite being different to other platform, they're defined with Unicode. This Unicode thing is a bit extend <Emoji client:idle emoji="🥸" />, so I'll just say that emojis tend to vary in appereance from device to device. I find these emojis so pleasant and colorful, so I wanted Linux to show them to me instead of the other ugly <Emoji client:idle emoji="🐽" /> alternatives. Easy task, someone already made a repository; download <Emoji client:idle emoji="📥" /> the font and apply it. However, something inside my mind <Emoji client:idle emoji="💆" /> was a bit off.

Well, this site is what I'm trying to call my personal website <Emoji client:idle emoji="🧘" />, so of course I want it to look perfect <Emoji client:idle emoji="✨" />. I wanted emojis on my website but as I mentioned before, emojis vary depending on the platform <Emoji client:idle emoji="📱" /> you're on. For example, your Android phone will likely show a Google variant for each emoji (As you might see: Your platform emoji: 😜. Apple emoji <Emoji client:idle emoji="😜" />). I wanted to show Apple emoji to all users when they visit this site, at least in this blog section; but how could I accomplish such task? <Emoji client:idle emoji="🤔" />

First, try to come up with a quick idea <Emoji client:idle emoji="💡" />. Maybe use images? But how to serve them. Local hosting? API? Downloading the whole emoji bundle and attaching it to my website repo wasn't something I preferred <Emoji client:idle emoji="🗯️" />. However, in one of my web browsing sessions I came across a proper solution. [A NodeJS package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/emoji-picker-react) <Emoji client:idle emoji="📦" />, gotta love these things. Integrated for React, which was already set up on my site. A couple hours later I had a working component that lazily fetched and displayed the emoji as and `<img>` I wanted. So nice. The code <Emoji client:idle emoji="⌨️" /> for the `Emoji.tsx` component looked like this:

```tsx
import { clamp } from "@utils/math";
import { Emoji as _Emoji } from "emoji-picker-react";

function getEmojiUrl(unified: string) {
  return (
    `https://cdn.staticfile.org/emoji-datasource-apple` +
    `/15.0.0/img/apple/64/${unified}.png`
  );
}

export default function Emoji(props: { emoji: string; size?: number }) {
  const unified = [...props.emoji]
    .map(e => e.codePointAt(0)!.toString(16))
    .join(`-`);
  const size = clamp(props.size ?? 19, 1, 64);

  return (
    <_Emoji lazyLoad unified={unified} getEmojiUrl={getEmojiUrl} size={size} />
  );
}
```

I you looked closely, you spotted a size <Emoji client:idle emoji="🐥" size={64}/> prop.

Next and final task, get it to my Markdown posts <Emoji client:idle emoji="📰" />. Well, turns out this is really easy <Emoji client:idle emoji="🥳" /> too. I set up MDX that allowed me to embed my React components into Markdown files, that was awesome.

And just as easy to use as:

```mdx
import Emoji from "@components/Emoji";

<Emoji client:idle emoji="🐱" />
```

Now I can easily spam emojis in my posts... <Emoji client:idle emoji="👹" />
